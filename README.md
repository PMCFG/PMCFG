PMCFG
=====

This repository defines a common exchange format for grammars that can be encoded as PMCFG, i.e., phrase-structure formalisms such as:

- CFG (context-free grammar)
- LCFRS (linear context-free rewriting systems)
- MCFG (multiple context-free grammar)

Our goal is that the format should be compact and easy to read, both for computers and humans. As proof-of-concept we supply readers and writers for several programming languages. Also included are command-line tools for converting grammars and extracting grammars from treebanks.
